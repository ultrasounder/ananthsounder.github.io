I am Ananth, and I maintain this as my brain dump. I heard somewhere that if i write down what I learn, there is a better chance of retaining it. So here goes. I hope to maintain this as my daily journal, BUT i wont let my perfectionism get in the way of creating something useful for folks who search the web for a particular thing that they want to learn. Hence i will prioritize quality over quantity to maintain a superior signal-noise ratio.
